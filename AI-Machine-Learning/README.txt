This is a compilation of my work done in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This folder was originally viewed in the Jet Brains PyCharm IDE 
(and should work fairly well if imported into PyCharm). If not imported, the python files should still work pretty well outside of that.

It Contains:

1. AIVacuum
    This project was to create an algorithm for a vacuum that will clean the floor without knowing the world map.

2. HandwritingRecognition
    This project was to use neural networks to recognize handwriting.

3. NeuralNetworks
    This was an introductory to neural networks.

4. Othello
    This is a AI solution to Othello (that tells you the best move)

5. PolynomialRegression
    This is a polynomial regression proof of concept.

6. PredictingVotes
    This is a project that predicts the votes for a given election using a decision tree.

6. TicTacToe
    This is an AI that plays Tic Tac Toe.

7. PythonExcercises
    This is a collection of python excercises (used to learn and grow my python skills).

8. UnsortedMess
    This is an unsorted mess of other projects and files.
