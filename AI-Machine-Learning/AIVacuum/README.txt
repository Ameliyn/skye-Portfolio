This project creates an artifically intelligent vacuum to clean a given space. There are a number of different agents that have differing levels of intelligence.

This contains:

1. stddraw.py, stdio.py, color.py
    Standard libraries.

2. vacuum.py
    A helper class that contains much of the world building and environment building for the vacuum.

3. vacuum_agents.py
   This class contains the different agents (this one should be run to see the results).
