Run the executable, "spin_torusA.exec" by typing

./spin_torusA.exec

Hit the 's' key to make it spin.


Your task is to write a program that duplicates
the behavior of this executable (you need not print the
text that shows in the window).

 Read the data from torusA.xyz 
 There are to be no command line arguments.
 The torusA.xyz data is centered at the origin
 but you should move it 3 units down the z-axis
 BEFORE displaying it.
 Use a half angle of 30 degrees.
 The screen must be 700 pixels wide and high.
 The program responds to only 2 keys :
 the 's' key will cause the torus to spin about the diagonal
 (1 degree per frame)
 and the 'q' key will cause the program to quit.
 The other keys do nothing.
 Note that the display is a simple wireframe.

 Solving the above is worth 90 percent of the test.
 To get the other 10 percent, you must compute
 and print the area of this polygonal approximation to
 a torus.  It may be useful to know that if A and B are two vectors,
 then the magnitude (length) of the cross product of A and B turns
 out to be the area of the parallelogram that 
 A and B span.
