3D Point cloud contains a number of projects that use the dot cloud/point cloud algorithm to draw objects.

1. pointCloud3D.c
    This is the first project that was mostly a proof of concept of the point cloud and ZBuffer modalities.

2. pointCloudLightModel.c
    This takes the point cloud and adds a light model to it.

3. pointCLoudTexture3D.c
    This takes the point cloud and allows for it to be textured. This uses a mapping of a square texture onto a non-square object.
