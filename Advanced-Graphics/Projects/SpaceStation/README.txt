This project involves using point clouds to simulate a basic space oddesy and Earth.

1. no_display_oddessy.c
    This script does the same thing as space_oddessy.c but rather doesn't display the images and only saves them (which saves some time on computation).

2. space_oddessy.c
    This script creates the space oddessy and displays it while also saving the files.
