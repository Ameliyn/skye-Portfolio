The purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with doing matrix manipulation on objects. These include scaling, transformation, rotation, etc.

1. M3d_test_sequence.c
    This script was used to test our use of 3D matricies and sequences of transformations.

2. stickfigure.c
    This script creates a stick figure that rotates and gets smaller.
