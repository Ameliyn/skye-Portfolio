For starters, I apologize for the mess that is this folder. I would clean it up but that would require a good deal of refactoring of the scripts and executables and 
frankly my time is better spent on bigger and better things.

This folder contains my work on raytracing. There are some gifs of the projects in the gifs folder. These gifs are lower quality than the ./video player but give the general idea.
Many of the scripts are mini-projects that lead up to my final project. More or less, my modality was to save versions of the scripts before making further headway which allowed
me to get bits and pieces of old scripts that work and coallesce them in a coherent way.

1. 2DSimpleRaytracer.c
    This project is mostly a proof of concept of raytracing, normal vectors, and reflections in a 2D space.

2. 3DSimpleRaytracer.c
    This project is also a proof of concept, but rather in 3D.

3. FinalProject.c
    This is an earlier version of the Final Project script. Because the final was completed using raytracing, this is where it originally lived.

4. FinalProjectPt1.c
    This is a portion of the completed final project script.

5. GlassTable.c
    This is a proof of concept of a semi-transperent, reflective glass table.

6. MirrorTest.c 
    This is a proof of concept of reflections and mirrors.

7. MirrorTestStudent.c
    This is a version of the MirrorTest.c script that was used as an assignment of other students.

8. MultipleLights.c
    This is a proof of concept for renderring multiple lights.

9. ShadowModel.c
    This is a proof of concept for shadows.

10. TableEarthModel.c
    This is a 3D representation of a globe on a table.

11. TestGlass.c
    This is a proof of concept for semi-transperent, semi-reflective glass.

12. TextureModel.c
    This is a proof of concept for texturing objects with raytracing.
